# ORB Extractor: Number of features per image

# ORB Extractor: Number of levels in the scale pyramid
ORBextractor.nLevels: 20

# ORB Extractor: Fast threshold
# Image is divided in a grid. At each cell FAST are extracted imposing a minimum response.
# Firstly we impose iniThFAST. If no corners are detected we impose a lower value minThFAST
# You can lower these values if your images have low contrast
ORBextractor.iniThFAST: 2

Software for the whole system
=====================================

ROS folder contains the ros files for the project, including ros nodes, driver scripts and some launch files for using third-party
ROS software, such as orb-slam2 ros package and darknet package.

Other folders contain the programs running on the target hardware. For example, the programs under BLE_Deck folder should be
built and then ran on the BLE Deck or other NRF52832-based board. The details can be found in the README file of each individual
folder.
